      "Extended User Prompt: Question: Tell me about the Napoleanic Wars\n",
      "Answer: The Napoleonic Wars were a series of conflicts that took place from 1803 to 1815, primarily involving France and its allies against various coalitions of European powers. These wars were primarily led by the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who aimed to extend French dominance across Europe and establish a Napoleonic Empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflicts began with the War of the Third Coalition in 1803, when Britain, Austria, and Russia formed an alliance against France. Napoleon achieved several victories, including the famous Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, which resulted in the dissolution of the Third Coalition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1806, the Fourth Coalition was formed by Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, resulting in Napoleon's victory over Prussia in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Napoleon went on to establish the Confederation of the Rhine, a network of client states under French influence in Germany.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Peninsular War from 1808 to 1814 was another significant conflict during this period. It involved Napoleon's attempt to subdue Spain and Portugal, where he faced fierce resistance from local guerrilla fighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The height of Napoleon's power came in 1812 when he invaded Russia with the largest army ever assembled up to that point. However, the disastrous Russian campaign resulted in the French forces suffering heavy casualties due to brutal weather conditions and scorched-earth tactics employed by the Russians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Napoleon's defeat in Russia, a Sixth Coalition was formed in 1813, consisting of Russia, Prussia, Austria, and other European powers, to finally defeat France. The coalition achieved significant victories, most notably at the Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations, which marked a turning point in the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several more battles and campaigns, the Napoleonic Wars ended with Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, where he faced a British-led coalition led by the Duke of Wellington.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wars had significant consequences for Europe. The French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic era had a profound impact, leading to revolutionary changes in political and social structures across the continent. Additionally, nationalism emerged as a powerful force during this period as different territories fought to assert their own identities and independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Napoleonic Wars redrew the political map of Europe, diminishing the power of traditional empires and reshaping the balance of power. It also set the stage for future conflicts and influenced warfare strategies and tactics for years to come.\n",
      "Stars: 5\n",
