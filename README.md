# AI App Developers Prototype

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources for the AI App Developers Prototype project. We aim to develop a prototype end-user facing product for AI app developers using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project is associated with Microsoft Azure and involves Azure AI, open-source toolkits, and metrics.

### Problem Statement

- **Objective:** Develop a user-friendly prototype for AI app developers utilizing LLMs.
- **Focus:** Mitigate business risks from generative AI and enhance user confidence in model results in production scenarios.
- **Platform:** Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure AI, open-source toolkits, and metrics.

### Requirements

#### Technology and Constraints

- Utilize Azure AI, open-source toolkits, and metrics.
- Cloud-based, powered by Azure with allocated budget for cloud resources.
- Focus on open-source technologies.
- Data from chatbot scenarios; identify relevant datasets using open-source, focusing on public data like bleu or rouge.

#### Target User Population/Stakeholders

- Microsoft developers using the Azure AI platform to create generative AI applications for end customers.
- Both developers and end users to benefit from the insights developed during the project.
- Students on the project team will interview internal developers.
